	<div><a class="intropar">Mental health - it is a factor that determines how people act, feel, and think. It is a general term that describes the 		mental capacity of the person, including how well the mind can manage stress and pressure. <br><br> This advocacy stands for the awareness of 		said subject. Mental health matters encourages people to speak up about their experiences, and promotes a positive relationship between the self	and one's own
		sanity.</a>

		<a class="historypar">For years, people have advocated for mental health. Several organizations haves stood up for the awareness of suppression due to the stigma society expects of mental health. <br><br> It is believed that the government is one of the main factors that lead to the stigmatization of the topic, as their first action is to protect the people from those who have disorders - deeming those	who have mental health issues as dangerous, to be feared upon.	"Treatments" from psychiatric wards lack any therapeutical value as	well, and instead inflict abuse			causing more damage to one's wellbeing (Funk, Minoletti, et al., 2005)</a>
